# Mailman
Local delivery system to avoid going through a major carrier so deliveries are as fast as they can possible be. Users are the delivery drivers for the packages. It avoids the fees and restrictions that major carriers have. Users exchange the money between each other (through the website to avoid fraud of course).

Technologies used:
* Python:
    * django
* Database:
    * Postgresql
